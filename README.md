## ✨ Highlights

- ⚛️ Built with **React** and modular **reusable components**, making the layout easy to maintain and scale.
- 🎨 Designed using **TailwindCSS** for ultra-fast UI styling and a fully responsive layout across devices.
- 🔁 Dynamic sections like Projects, Resume, Skills, and Socials are driven through reusable mapped data objects.
- 🌙 Integrated **Dark Mode toggle**, saved via local storage for theme persistence.
- 🔗 Live previews and GitHub links for every project card — all interactive and componentized.
- 🧠 Component architecture promotes **separation of concerns**, minimal prop-drilling, and maximum readability.
- 💫 Smooth page transitions and subtle animations via Tailwind and utility-first class optimizations.

This project showcases not just what I’ve built — but **how** I build: clean, scalable, user-focused interfaces with a keen eye for design and performance.
